# data-analyst-portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio

I am a data analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data to support business decision-making. I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. I also have a solid understanding of key analytical techniques such as data cleaning, merging, statistical analysis, dashboard creation, and report writing.

This portfolio presents a selection of projects that demonstrate my technical and analytical skills. It includes dashboards and reports created in Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, showcasing my ability to present data clearly and effectively for both technical and non-technical audiences.

You will also find examples of my work in Python, SQL, and R, where I have extracted insights from large and complex datasets, combined data from multiple sources, and built end-to-end analytical workflows.

In addition to technical proficiency, I bring strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, aiming not just to answer questions but to uncover opportunities and support informed decisions.

I hope you find this portfolio informative and engaging. I would be happy to discuss any of the projects in more detail or talk about potential collaboration.

Thank you for visiting.
