# data-analyst-portfolio

I'm a data analyst with experience in turning data into meaningful insights that support business decisions. I work confidently with tools like Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and I’m skilled in core analytics techniques such as data cleaning, merging, dashboard development, and reporting.

In this portfolio, you’ll find a selection of projects that highlight both my technical capabilities and my approach to solving real-world problems with data. These include interactive dashboards and business reports built with Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, designed to present complex information in a clear and accessible way.

I’ve also included examples of data analysis using Python, SQL, and R, where I worked with large and varied datasets, integrated multiple data sources, and delivered practical insights through custom analysis workflows.

Alongside my technical skills, I value critical thinking and a strategic mindset. I approach every project with curiosity and a focus on uncovering patterns, identifying opportunities, and making data-driven recommendations that matter.

Thanks for taking the time to explore my work. If you're interested in any of the projects or would like to connect, feel free to reach out.
